I'm just gonna lay out what i've done so far to help out anyone whos tryin to figure out how this mod works (keep in mind i havent gotten the formatting to work with ultra-wide monitors yet but if i do i'll try to remember to put a note here). 

download the mod so you have the files on your computer, either by subscribing to it via the workshop or by downloading it to your server and using your server as a way to download the mod (as downloading off the workshop didnt work for me for some reason.)

now, open @SimpleCustomLoadingScreen (should be found in your !dzsal folder in your game directory, or somewhere else i havent figured out lmao) nd right click and edit the meta.cpp. rename where it says SimpleCustomLoadingScreen to your preferred modname. you will change your id number too but not until after you've uploaded your reworked mod onto the workshop for the first time. save meta.cpp

open your Addons folder and open the folder labeled Loadingscreen. inside this folder delete the loadingscreen.edds. take your preferred loadingscreen.png at 2048x1024 res and open it in tex view via the dayz tools on steam. change where it says RGBA to RGB in the drop-down menu on the left side. file > open > find your loadingscreen.png. open it. file > save as > rename the file loadingscreen.edds and save it in the Loadingscreen folder in place of the loadingscreen.edds file you deleted(to make this work you may have to change the viewable file extensions in the dropdown to All Files when saving in tex view). 

now if you move the Loadingscreen.pbo thats in the addon folder to your desktop (or anywhere just somewhere besides where it is) and unpack it via PBOManager, you'll find a file called $PREFIX$. I havent been able to figure out how to make this file so keep it safe somewhere, you need it to repack your Loadingscreen folder into a PBO correctly. copy this file into the Loadingscreen folder (located in your Addons folder), and open PBOManager. find the Loadingscreen folder in PBOManager and right click on the folder, go down to where it says PBO Manager, and click "pack into .pbo". this will run a quick script and then you'll see a new Loadinscreen.pbo in your Addons folder. 

now open Arma 3 tools via steam and open DSUtils. click add source directory and locate your Addons folder within @SimpleCustomLoadingScreen. click the button with the N next to "Private key". rename your key to something identifiable. set your destination path to the Addons folder. click Create key. Then click process files. in your addons folder you should have 4 new files; a txt, a BIKEY, a BIPRIVATEKEY, and a BISIGN. move the txt and the BIPRIVATEKEY somewhere safe. 

now rename @SimpleCustomLoadingScreen to @YourModName (replace YourModName with something unique, this is the name of your mod and should match EXACTLY what you called your mod in the meta.cpp.) 

now you should have a folder named @YourModName (YourModName being replaced by your unique mod name) that contains a meta.cpp, and an Addons folder. the addons folder should contain your BIKEY file, your BISIGN file, and your Loadingscreen.pbo. 

open publisher via the DayZ tools on steam, Set the Name to match @YourModName but without the @ (ex. "YourModName"). change the tags to Animation. Visibility to Public. find the directory for your @YourModName folder  and upload that directory to publisher where it says Mod content. check to make sure it says mod structure is valid and that it shows your signature file name when you hover over "Signatures". Put a description. Upload. once you've uploaded your mod, go to its workshop page and in the URL you should find a 10 digit number right after where it says "id=". copy this number and open the meta.cpp again. put this number in place of the old publishedid. save. now find your mod on the Publisher tool via DayZ tools. click on your mod under (new Workshop item) and find your mod folder directory once again where it says Mod content. check to make sure it says your mod structure is valid and the keys are there where it says "Signatures". Update. 

Now you should be able to download your newly repackaged mod onto your server and then your server will ask you to download it to your host. when you download it to your server, check to see if the BIKEY file was saved in your keys folder in your server host directory. if its still located in your mod folder after being installed on your server, move it to your keys folder(do this when your server is not starting up, running, or shutting down to avoid corruption). start your game and you should see your new loading screen with 0 issues (unless you have an ultra-wide like me lol).

I hope this helps someone as i had to spent about 4-5 days figuring this out on my lonesome :steammocking:
